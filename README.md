# Estimated EU Referendum Results by Neighbourhood

The 2016 Referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union (EU) was the most significant event in recent British political history, with huge ongoing implications. It is now a central component of the study of British politics, not only for its political economy and policy implications but also for its relevance to electoral behaviour and geography. Leave and Remain have become persistent identities helping to explain behaviour in a wide range of settings.

Using Multi-Level Regression and Poststratification (MRP), I have estimated EU Referendum Results for “Middle Super Output Areas” (MSOAs). MSOAs are small geographical areas, corresponding to neighbourhoods, towns or groups of villages, with an average population of 7,200. They are useful for geographic analysis because they are relatively small, similarly sized and consistent across England and Wales. In Scotland, I have used the equivalent Intermediate Zones (average population 4,100). Sadly, data was not available to perform this analysis in Northern Ireland.

Final predicted results are available in [msoa_results.csv](https://github.com/owenwntr/ward_euref_mrp/blob/main/msoa_results.csv).

A step-by-step guide to the project is in [HOWTO_COMPILE.R](https://github.com/owenwntr/ward_euref_mrp/blob/main/HOWTO_COMPILE.R).
